## Package Manager Commands <a id="pm"></a>

<hr/>

### rpm

rpm -e oshan.rpm

## Verify package named "oshan.rpm"
rpm -V oshan.rpm

## List all the RPM packages
rpm -qa
```

Generally, most of the distros use their own package manager, and it's prefereable to use package manager like `yum` or `dnf` instead of rpm because it handles all the dependencies.  
I use OpenSUSE, and I have `zypper` as my package manager.

`apt` is used commonly for Debian family systems to handle dpkg.

## Linux Remote Commands <a id="remote"></a>

<hr/>

### ssh (Secure Shell)

SSH lets you connect remote systems and enables secured transfer of files over insecure networks. It is used widely over its predecessors `telnet` which isn't as secured as SSH, and there are possible problems like eavesdropping.

```bash
## Install ssh server (On debian systems )
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

## Install ssh server on OpenSUSE or you can use your Package Manager
sudo zypper install openssh-server

## Start ssh server
sudo service ssh start

## Check ssh server status
sudo service ssh status

## Connect to remote server
ssh <username>@<host_ip_address>

## Connect to host using specific port
ssh -p <port> <username>@<host_ip_address>
```

<hr/>

### telnet

Telnet is a client-server protocol based on TCP connections. It dates back to almost 50 years ago. SSH is preferred over, but still it doesn't hurt to learn about this as it is still in use.

```bash
## Install ssh server (On debian systems )
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

## Install ssh server on OpenSUSE or you can use your Package Manager
sudo zypper install openssh-server

## start the connection setup
telnet <hostname>

## start using IP address and port number
telnet <IP_ADDRESS> <PORT>
```

<hr/>

## Linux File Permission Commands <a id="fp"></a>

<hr/>

### chmod

Change the file access rights. The permission is expressed in **three sets** of **three characters** to denote permission for file owner, group owner, and all other users.

For files:
| rwx | rwx | rwx |  
| --- | --- | --- |
|Read, write, and execute permission for file owner | Read, write and execute permission for group owner | Read, write, and execute permission for all other users

Here, we will use _octal notation_ to make changes to file permissions.

```
rwx rwx rwx 111 111 111
--- --- --- 000 000 000
rw- rw- rw- 110 110 110

111 => 7
110 => 6
101 => 5
100 => 4
011 => 3
010 => 2
001 => 1
000 => 0
```

So, it's easy to give permission using octal notation to files.

```bash
## Give read, write, and execution permission to everybody
chmod 777 index.js

## Give read, write, and execution permission to nobody
chmod 000 index.js

## Give all permission to directory owner and no permission to anybody else
chmod 700 dir

#  Recursively set read, write, and execute permissions to the file owner and no permissions for all other users on a given directory:

chmod -R 700 dirname

# Recursively Change the File’s Permissions

# To recursively operate on all files and directories under the given directory, use the -R (--recursive) option:

chmod -R MODE DIRECTORY

# For example, to change the permissions of all files and subdirectories under the /var/www directory to 755 you would use:

chmod -R 755 /var/www

```

<hr/>

### sudo

Get superuser (root) privileges temporarily. You need to enter root password for that. There are some commands that need superuser privileges because the file containing them don't have permission for other users.

```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

<hr/>

### chown

Change ownership of files. You need sudo privileges for executing this command.

```bash
## Change ownership of index.js from user to root
sudo chown root index.js
```

<hr/>

### chgrp

Change group owner of file. You need sudo privileges for executing this command.

```bash
## Change group ownership of index.js from user to root
sudo chgrp root index.js
```

<hr/>
